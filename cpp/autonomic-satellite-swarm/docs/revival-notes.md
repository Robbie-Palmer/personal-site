# Revival notes

The original code was a useful summer-internship proof of concept. This revival preserves its
research story while removing defects that would obscure or destabilize further experimentation.

## Corrected defects

| Prior behavior | Risk | Revival |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SynMessage` was allocated with `new` and never safely released. | Heap exhaustion and unclear ownership on an embedded target. | Messages are values; the core performs no dynamic allocation. |
| The current SYN pointer and mock health state could be read uninitialized. | Undefined behavior and intermittent crashes. | All state is initialized and transitions are guarded. |
| Agent IDs indexed a fixed three-element array without validation. | Out-of-bounds memory writes from a malformed message. | IDs and configured capacity are validated against bounded storage. |
| IDs were decoded with mask `0x0011`. | Most eight-bit IDs decoded incorrectly. | The new codec encodes each field explicitly and has round-trip tests. |
| Signed shifts and platform-dependent `long` represented the protocol. | Undefined behavior and different layouts across platforms. | Fixed-width integers and explicit big-endian encoding define the wire format. |
| A 32-bit payload was sent through Sony IR framing despite Sony's standard frame sizes. | Interoperability and decoding ambiguity. | The Uno adapter uses four documented 32-bit NEC raw frames. |
| The IR receiver was not started in `setup`. | A device might never receive the first message. | Adapter initialization is explicit. |
| Long blocking delays ran in the main loop and reset path. | Missed messages and frozen state progression. | Coordination is driven by elapsed time; only short physical IR frame gaps remain. |
| Timer state did not initialize and its rollover concern remained unresolved. | Undefined first read and failure around `millis()` rollover. | The caller supplies time and rollover-safe elapsed arithmetic is tested. |
| The orbital calculation accepted invalid coordinates and had undefined zero-time cases. | NaN, division by zero, and misleading scores. | Inputs are validated; exact arrival scores `100`; historical examples remain characterized. |
| An active node could initiate a new mission. | Starting another negotiation overwrote its current assignment. | Only an idle node may initiate or accept a mission. |
| The wire encoder accepted unknown message-type values that its decoder rejected. | Locally generated packets could violate the protocol contract. | Encoding and decoding now enforce the same closed set of message types. |
| Non-finite physical inputs passed the historical scorer's positivity checks. | NaN or infinite arithmetic could produce undefined or misleading scores. | All physical inputs must be finite and positive. |
| Protocol state advanced even when a transport rejected the outgoing message. | A local node could report progress or safe-disable on communication evidence that never existed. | Initiation, candidacy, and assignment transitions now depend on successful transport acceptance. |
| Queued messages were handled before negotiation deadlines. | Late candidates, acknowledgements, or assignments could alter an expired phase. | Timed transitions run before the bounded receive loop. |
| The historical energy calculation squared a scaled latitude distance. | Small positive radii could underflow the denominator to zero. | The algebraically equivalent degree ratio avoids the squared denominator and rejects non-finite energy. |
| An update drained the transport until it became empty. | A busy or adversarial transport could make one update's execution time unbounded. | Configuration limits the number of messages processed per update. |
| The ESP-NOW adapter allowed sends and receives before successful initialization. | Callers could accidentally rely on platform error behavior instead of the adapter contract. | Both operations require a successfully completed `begin`. |
| The IR fragment count and packet size were related only by convention. | A future size change could make the masked chunk index address beyond the packet. | Compile-time assertions bind the two-bit index, chunk layout, and packet size. |
| Every firmware build hard-coded node ID `0`. | Multiple boards could not participate as distinct nodes. | Both adapters require the shared `SATELLITE_SWARM_NODE_ID` build definition; mise validates and supplies it. |
| A direct assignment could complete negotiation without clearing earlier communication failures. | A later isolated failure could safe-disable a node despite an intervening successful negotiation. | Accepting a matching assignment now resets the consecutive-failure evidence, just like accepting its acknowledgement. |
| A replacement scorer could return values above the protocol's `0..100` range. | Local candidacies could be encoded but rejected by peers, or local and remote candidates could be compared under different rules. | The controller bounds every local scorer result before comparison or transmission. |
| CMake contained an invalid project name, stale include paths, duplicated sources, and no CTest registration. | The advertised host workflow was not reproducible. | Presets, named targets, CTest discovery, warnings, sanitizers, and mise tasks form one workflow. |

## Revisited design choices

Not every modernization is a correction. Some original choices were reasonable responses to a
small embedded target and the tooling available at the time:

- Communication, health, scoring, and state transitions were tightly integrated. That may have
  been an intentional way to control flash, RAM, and protocol overhead. Separating them behind
  `Transport`, `HealthMonitor`, and `CandidacyScorer` changes source-code dependencies; it does not
  require extra wire messages. The abstraction cost still needs to be checked in firmware size and
  memory reports. A future constrained target should compare the current runtime interfaces with
  static or compile-time composition rather than assume either design is cheaper.
- Catch2 2.x [officially supported its single-header
  distribution](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/v2.13.10/docs/slow-compiles.md), so vendoring
  `catch.hpp` was not itself a defect. For a CMake project, Catch2 3.x [documents exported CMake
  targets and `FetchContent`](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/v3.16.0/docs/cmake-integration.md);
  the revival therefore pins a release and links `Catch2::Catch2WithMain`. The historical gap was
  dependency provenance and an update process, not the single-header format. FakeIt also supported
  single-header use; the revival's narrow ports happen to need only small purpose-built fakes.

## Intentional behavior changes

- An active node ignores new mission requests instead of entering an extra communication-health
  sub-state. Busy-node health checks need their own explicit protocol.
- Multi-hop rebroadcasting is deferred. The reference transports currently model one broadcast
  domain.
- A follower enters safe-disabled only after the configured number of consecutive missions fail to
  acknowledge its candidacy. A valid acknowledgement resets that evidence.
- Equal scores currently select the lowest node ID to keep tests and replays deterministic. This
  creates a known fairness and wear bias; it is not the desired long-term allocation policy.
- Safe-disabled currently inhibits participation in software only. A physical safe-state action
  requires an explicit, platform-specific actuator port and evidence from real hardware.

Telemetry, fair resource-aware allocation, controlled mission-control intervention, and a physical
safe-state hook are scoped in [Next research cycle](next-research-cycle.md). They are deliberately
not implied by this revival's current behavior.

## Verification boundary

Host tests cover scoring examples, validation, message corruption, negotiation, retries, health
transitions, busy nodes, deterministic selection, and clock rollover. The host simulation exercises
three controllers over an in-memory broadcast bus. CI also compiles both firmware sketches.

Physical radio timing, electrical behavior, callback concurrency under load, sensor calibration, and
actual mission execution remain unverified without hardware.
