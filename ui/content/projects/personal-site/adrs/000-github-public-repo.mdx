# Context

I need a place to host the source code for this project. The requirements are:

* **Visibility**: It must be public to serve as a portfolio piece and reference implementation.
* **Reliability**: It needs to be hosted on a stable, industry-standard platform.
* **Collaboration**: It should support standard workflows for version control, issue tracking, and CI/CD integration.
* **Ecosystem**: It should integrate easily with other tools (Vercel, Cloudflare, etc.).

# Decision

I decided to host the repository publicly on **GitHub**.

This aligns with several guiding principles:

* **Choose Boring Technologies**: GitHub is the default, status quo choice for open source software. It is reliable, well-understood, and ubiquitous.
* **Build in Public**: Making the repo public invites feedback, sharing knowledge, and demonstrating technical capability as a portfolio artifact.
* **Minimize Platforms**: I already use GitHub for my professional work and other open source contributions. Using it here avoids creating a new account or learning a new interface.

# Consequences

### Pros

* **Zero Learning Curve**: I can leverage my existing years of experience with GitHub actions, secrets, and workflows.
* **Integration**: Seamless integration with almost every developer tool (CI/CD, code analysis, deployment targets).
* **Community**: It is the go-to place for open source, making it easier for others to discover, fork, or learn from this project.
* **Trust**: A public GitHub profile is a standard signal of technical activity for engineers.

### Cons

* **Vendor Lock-in**: Deep reliance on GitHub Actions and specific features can make migrating to GitLab or Bitbucket difficult later (though accepted as a low risk given GitHub's dominance).
