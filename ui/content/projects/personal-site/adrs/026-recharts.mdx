# Context

I am migrating a "How to Build Wealth" blog post that was originally written as a Jupyter notebook on fastpages with plots generated using Altair. I need a charting library that integrates deeply with my [React](/projects/personal-site/adrs/002-react) and [Next.js](/projects/personal-site/adrs/003-next-js) stack.

The requirements are:

* **Deep React Integration**: The library should feel native to React (component-based, prop-driven) rather than a wrapper around an imperative library.
* **Customizability**: Ability to style charts to match the site's [Tailwind CSS](/projects/personal-site/adrs/005-tailwindcss) design system.
* **Performance**: Capable of handling reasonable datasets for personal finance without main-thread blocking.
* **Responsiveness**: Charts must adapt seamlessly to mobile and desktop viewports.

# Decision

I will use **Recharts** for all data visualization on the site.

Recharts is a composable charting library built on React components. It uses SVG for rendering, which offers excellent scalability and accessibility.

# Alternatives Considered

## Non-React / Python-Centric Ecosystems

**Plotly (React Wrapper)**:

* **Pros**: I have deep experience with this tool from multiple jobs and data science visualization work. Incredible power, scientific standard, interactive out of the box (pan/zoom), consistent with Python data science workflow.
* **Cons**: Massive bundle size (megabytes), API feels "foreign" in a React codebase (configuration objects vs components), distinct "Plotly look" that is hard to customize to match a specific brand without fighting the library.
* **Why not**: Too heavy and biased towards scientific apps. I want charts that look like *my* site, not like a Jupyter notebook.

**Altair (Vega-Lite)**:

* **Pros**: The plots for the blog post already exist as Altair plots. Declarative grammar of graphics, immensely powerful for exploratory data analysis.
* **Cons**: primarily Python-based generation. Embedding in React often involves passing JSON specs to a Vega listener. Styling is constrained by the grammar and hard to marry with Tailwind.
* **Why not**: Great for analysis, poor for building bespoke custom frontend experiences.

## React Ecosystem Competitors

**Nivo**:

* **Pros**: Built on D3, beautiful defaults, supports SVG, Canvas, and HTML layers.
* **Cons**: API is heavily configuration-object based. You pass a giant prop object to configure everything.
* **Why not**: Recharts' composable API (`<LineChart><Line /><XAxis /></LineChart>`) is more readable and flexible to me than Nivo's configuration objects. It feels more "React-like."

**Victory**:

* **Pros**: robust, opinionated, good React Native support.
* **Cons**: Significantly less popular than Recharts, and their example page is much less impressive. Can be verbose.
* **Why not**: Subjective preference for Recharts' API composition style. Recharts has slightly higher adoption and community resources.

**Chart.js (react-chartjs-2)**:

* **Pros**: Canvas-based (great for massive datasets with thousands of points), huge ecosystem.
* **Cons**: Canvas rendering makes CSS styling tricky (everything is inside the canvas). Responsive resizing can sometimes be finicky. The React wrapper is just a thin layer over the imperative Chart.js API.
* **Why not**: SVG (Recharts) is easier to style with CSS and debug in the DOM. I don't have massive datasets requiring Canvas performance.

# Consequences

**Positive:**

* **Composition**: I can build complex charts by composing simple sub-components (`<XAxis />`, `<Tooltip />`, `<ReferenceLine />`).
* **Styling**: SVG elements are part of the DOM, meaning I can inspect them and often style them with CSS/Tailwind classes (though Recharts has its own prop styling system too).
* **Responsiveness**: `<ResponsiveContainer />` handles resizing logic automatically.
* **Velocity**: Rapid development of standard chart types (Line, Bar, Area, Pie).

**Negative:**

* **Abstraction Leaks**: It is a wrapper around D3. Sometimes you hit a wall and wish you had raw D3 access, or have to deal with quirks of the wrapper.
* **Performance**: SVG DOM nodes can get heavy if plotting thousands of points (unlike Canvas-based Chart.js).
* **Animation Janky-ness**: Complex animations can sometimes cause re-render loops or jank if not careful.
