# Context

I need a system for styling the application.
Traditional approaches like generic CSS or CSS Modules often lead to:

* **Append-only Stylesheets**: Developers fear breaking existing pages, so they just add new classes, leading to bloat.
* **Inconsistency**: Without strict enforcement, "slightly different" margins and colors proliferate.
* **Context Switching**: Jumping between `.tsx` and `.css` files slows down the feedback loop.

I want a solution that prioritizes **velocity** and **consistency** while playing well with the modern React ecosystem.

# Decision

I decided to use **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**.

Styling directly in the markup eliminates context switching—tighter [Short Feedback Loops](/projects?tab=philosophy#short-feedback-loops). Constrained tokens enforce a design system.

# Consequences

### Pros

* **Velocity**: Styling is significantly faster. I don't need to name classes or switch files.
* **Locality of Behavior**: Code and style live together. Deleting a component deletes its styles automatically.
* **AI Compatibility**: LLMs are excellent at writing Tailwind—[LLM-Optimized](/projects?tab=philosophy#llm-optimized). The text-based nature of utility classes is easier for models to predict than arbitrary CSS class names + separate CSS files.
* **Consistency**: We are forced to use the design system values (spacing, colors) defined in the config, preventing "magic numbers".

### Cons

* **Markup Bloat**: HTML classes can become very long and harder to scan (mitigated by component extraction and tooling).
* **Vendor Lock-in**: Hard dependency on the Tailwind compiler and syntax, though it is currently the industry standard.
