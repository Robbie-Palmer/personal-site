# Context

Instead of duplicating version constraints in both package.json and
Dependabot config, use semver ranges (^) in package.json as the single
source of truth.
This prevents breaking changes from:

* Next.js 16 (async APIs, caching changes, middleware → proxy)
* Vitest 4 (vi.importActual breaking changes)
* React 20 (future breaking changes)
  Dependabot doesn't respect semver ranges in package.json when proposing
  updates. It will still try to update ^15.5.6 → ^16.0.1.

This is a known limitation: [Dependabot issue #5176](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/5176)

configure Renovate for safer dependency updates

* Require manual approval for major version updates via dependency dashboard
* Auto-merge minor/patch updates for devDependencies when CI passes
* Auto-merge minor/patch GitHub Actions updates when CI passes
* Enable lock file maintenance with auto-merge

# Decision

I will migrate from Dependabot to [**Renovate**](https://docs.renovate.com/) for automated dependency updates.

Renovate respects semver ranges in package.json, preventing unwanted major version updates while still automating minor and patch updates. This addresses the core limitation identified with Dependabot: the inability to use package.json semver constraints as the single source of truth for acceptable version ranges.

Renovate is essentially a more sophisticated interface layer built on top of GitHub's dependency infrastructure. It integrates deeply with the same GitHub APIs and dependency graph that Dependabot uses, but provides significantly more configurability and control. The service is free for open-source projects, sponsored by Mend.io (the company behind Renovate).

Configuration:

* **Dependency Dashboard**: Manual approval required for major version updates via GitHub issues
* **Auto-merge**: Minor/patch updates for devDependencies auto-merge when CI passes
* **Auto-merge**: Minor/patch GitHub Actions updates auto-merge when CI passes
* **Lock File Maintenance**: Enabled with auto-merge to keep transitive dependencies current

# Consequences

### Pros

* **Semver Range Awareness**: Renovate respects `^` and `~` constraints in package.json, preventing breaking changes from being proposed automatically. This solves the Next.js 16, Vitest 4, and React 20 upgrade concerns—they won't be auto-proposed until I update the semver range in package.json.
* **Single Source of Truth**: Version constraints live in package.json, not duplicated in dependency tooling config. Cleaner, less error-prone.
* **Reduced PR Noise**: Auto-merge for safe updates (minor/patch devDependencies, Actions updates) dramatically reduces manual review burden while maintaining safety via CI gates.
* **Dependency Dashboard**: Major updates are grouped in a single GitHub issue for review, making it easy to see what's waiting and decide when to tackle breaking changes.
* **Lock File Maintenance**: Automated updates to transitive dependencies keep the lock file fresh without manual intervention.
* **GitHub Native Integration**: Builds on the same dependency infrastructure as Dependabot, leveraging GitHub's dependency graph and APIs. It's essentially a better UI layer on top of the same foundation.
* **Still Boring Technology**: Renovate is widely used, well-documented, and has excellent AI/LLM training data. It's the industry standard for teams that need more control than Dependabot provides.

### Cons

* **More Complex Configuration**: Renovate requires more upfront configuration than Dependabot. The tradeoff is worthwhile for the control it provides, but it's not as zero-config as Dependabot.
* **Sponsorship Dependency**: While free for open-source projects today (sponsored by Mend.io), this relies on continued corporate sponsorship. There's a risk that the free tier could be reduced or converted to paid in the future, forcing a migration back to Dependabot or another tool.
* **External Platform**: Renovate runs as a GitHub App, adding a dependency on an external service (though still tightly integrated with GitHub). This slightly deviates from "Minimize Platforms," but the velocity gains justify the tradeoff.
