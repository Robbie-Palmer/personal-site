# Context

I need a unit testing framework to verify logic and prevent regressions.
The standard in the React ecosystem for years has been **Jest**. However, frameworks have evolved:

* **Performance**: Jest can be slow, especially in TypeScript projects where it relies on `ts-jest` or Babel transforms, leading to long feedback loops.
* **Configuration Overhead**: Setting up Jest to understand ESM modules, TypeScript, and modern browser APIs often requires complex configuration and duplicate setup (separate `jest.config.js` distinct from the build config).
* **Alternatives**:
* **Mocha/Chai**: Flexible but fragmented ecosystem; requires stitching together runner, assertion library, and mocking tools.
* **Node.js Test Runner**: Integrated but relatively new and lacks the rich ecosystem of matchers and plugins found in Jest/Vitest.

I want a testing tool that brings the same **velocity** benefits as the rest of my stack.

# Decision

I decided to use **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)**.

Vitest is a Vite-native unit test framework. Although we use distinct configurations ([ADR 005: Turbopack](/projects/personal-site/adrs/005-turbopack) for dev, Vitest for test), it aligns with the modern ecosystem and offers superior performance.

*Note*: We **cannot** use Vite for the main application build or development server because Next.js ([ADR 002](/projects/personal-site/adrs/002-next-js)) is tightly coupled to its own compiler (Webpack/Turbopack) for features like React Server Components and the App Router. However, we *can* leverage the Vite engine exclusively for running unit tests via Vitest.

# Consequences

### Pros

* **Speed**: Powered by Vite and utilizing native ESM, it provides instant startup and hot module replacement (HMR) for tests. This tightens the "edit-test-debug" loop.
* **Simplicity**: While it requires a `vitest.config.ts` (since we use Turbopack for development), the configuration is significantly lighter and more standard than a comparable Jest setup.
* **Jest Compatibility**: The API is nearly identical to Jest (`describe`, `it`, `expect`), meaning zero learning curve and easy portability if needed.

### Cons

* **Ecosystem Maturity**: While rapidly growing, it has fewer dedicated plugins than Jest (though heavily compatible with existing ones).
* **Configuration Split**: Since we use **Turbopack** for the Next.js dev server, we do not share a single `vite.config.ts` for both app and tests. Vitest runs in its own Vite instance, requiring its own (albeit minimal) config file.
