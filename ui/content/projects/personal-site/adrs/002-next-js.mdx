# Context

I need a framework to build the UI for my personal site.
My previous site was built using **[fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai/)** (which is built on top of Jekyll/Ruby) to deploy to GitHub Pages. While it served its purpose initially, it has significant drawbacks:

* **Archived Project**: `fastpages` is now archived and no longer maintained.
* **Rigid Structure**: It was designed for a specific blogging use case, offering little flexibility for custom features or deeper integration.
* **Language Alignment**: Customizing the underlying Jekyll functionality requires Ruby. I maintain a strategic focus on a core set of languages—**TypeScript, Python, Terraform**—to maximize mastery and context switching efficiency. Adopting a Ruby-based stack diverts from this goal.

I want a modern framework that:

* Is ubiquitous and "boring" (well-understood, stable).
* Has a massive ecosystem of libraries and components.
* Is deeply understood by AI coding agents to facilitate high-velocity development.
* Provides an "escape hatch" to add dynamic, server-side functionality later without a rewrite.
* Uses **TypeScript**, which is the default, "boring" choice for modern web development and essential for robust client-side applications.

# Decision

I decided to use **Next.js (React)** with **TypeScript**.

This aligns with the **Choose Boring Technologies** principle. React is the de facto standard for component-based UIs, Next.js is the standard framework for React, and TypeScript is the standard language for modern web development.

# Consequences

### Pros

* **AI-Native Development**: LLMs are incredibly proficient at generating React/Next.js code due to the sheer volume of training data available. This enables a highly efficient "agentic" workflow.
* **Ubiquity**: The ecosystem is massive. If I need a carousel, a chart, or an animation, there is a production-ready library available.
* **Scalability**: While currently serving static content via SSG (Static Site Generation), Next.js handles SSR (Server Side Rendering) and API routes out of the box. If I want to add auth or database connectivity later, the infrastructure is already there—no rewrite needed.
* **Modern DX**: TypeScript support, hot reloading, and component isolation are superior to the Jekyll experience.

### Cons

* **Vendor Lock-in**: Next.js is heavily optimized for Vercel. While it *can* be hosted elsewhere (e.g., Docker, open-next), doing so often loses some "magic" or requires extra configuration.
* **Complexity**: For a purely static blog, Next.js ships more JavaScript and has a more complex build process than a simple HTML generator like Hugo or Jekyll.
* **Overkill**: SSR features are currently unused, adding theoretical weight to the framework choice, but accepted as the cost of future flexibility.
