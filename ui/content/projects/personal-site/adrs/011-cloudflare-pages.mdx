# Context

I need a hosting platform for the personal site that provides:

1. **Global Performance**: Fast static asset delivery via a CDN.
2. **Developer Experience**: Automated CI/CD, specifically "Preview Deployments" for every Pull Request to facilitate the review workflow \[ADR 009].
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Predictable pricing, avoiding "bandwidth billing shocks".
4. **Ecosystem Synergy**: Tight integration with the DNS and security layer.

# Decision

I will use **Cloudflare Pages**.

It offers a "git-ops" style workflow where connecting a repository automatically sets up the build and deploy pipeline, including preview environments.

# Alternatives

## Vercel

Vercel is the creators of Next.js and offers the "gold standard" DX for Next.js apps.

* **Status**: Strong Future Candidate.
* **Pros**: Best-in-class support for Next.js features (SSR, ISR, Image Optimization) out of the box. Zero configuration.
* **Cons**:
* **Architecture**: Vercel's default compute model (Node.js Serverless Functions) is region-centralized (e.g., `us-east-1`), whereas Cloudflare Pages is natively edge-deployed across 275+ cities.
* **Vendor Lock-in**: Heavy usage of Vercel-specific primitives can make it harder to migrate away.
* **Cost**: The pricing model can get expensive at scale.
* **Reasoning**: There is a high chance of migrating to Vercel in the future if I need heavy Server-Side Rendering (SSR). However, "not now" - since I already have Cloudflare configured for DNS/Domains, I want to leverage the synergies of a single platform and the pure edge architecture for this static-first site.

## GitHub Pages

* **Pros**: Completely free, right next to the code.
* **Cons**:
* **Basic**: Lacks native "Preview Deployments" on PRs (requires complex custom Actions workflows).
* **Performance**: Slower propagation and generic CDN performance compared to Cloudflare's enterprise-grade edge.

## AWS S3 + CloudFront

The traditional "Boring Tech" infrastructure approach.

* **Pros**: Maximum control, industry standard, rock-solid stability.
* **Cons**:
* **Complexity**: Significantly higher operational overhead. Requires managing certificates, cache invalidation, and bucket policies manually (or via Terraform).
* **DX**: No out-of-the-box preview deployments. Setting up per-branch infrastructure is a major project in itself.

# Consequences

### Pros

* **Performance**: Deployed to Cloudflare's massive global edge network (275+ cities).
* **Cost**: Cloudflare Pages offers unlimited bandwidth for static requests on the free tier.
* **Workflow**: Automatic preview deployments for every PR allow me to verify changes in a real environment before merging—[Fast Feedback Loops](/projects?tab=philosophy#fast-feedback-loops)—reinforcing the "CodeRabbit" \[ADR 009] review workflow.
* **Consolidation**: Aligns with [Minimize Platforms](/projects?tab=philosophy#minimize-platforms) by keeping DNS, Domain, and Hosting under one roof.
* **Skill Synergy**: I use Cloudflare extensively at work, but not Vercel. Using Cloudflare Pages deepens my expertise with the platform I rely on professionally.

### Cons

* **Next.js Features**: While Next.js works well, using "Edge Runtimes" or specific ISR features requires careful configuration using `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` or reverting to full Static Site Generation (SSG). This helps enforce simplicity but adds a compatibility check step for new Next.js features.
