# Context

I need to manage DNS records for my domain (`robbiepalmer.me`).

**Historical Context**: On my previous project (`robbiepalmer.com`), I used **Dynadot** for both registration and DNS.
The experience highlighted several pain points with the traditional registrar approach:

1. **Manual Processes**: DNS management was entirely GUI-based ("Click-Ops"), making it error-prone and tedious.
2. **No Versioning**: There was no history of changes or ability to rollback.
3. **Platform Sprawl**: DNS was disconnected from the hosting (GitHub Pages at the time) and other infrastructure.

For the new site (`robbiepalmer.me`), I want to avoid these issues and ensure DNS is treated as infrastructure code.

# Decision

I will use **Cloudflare DNS** as the authoritative nameserver for `robbiepalmer.me`.
I will manage the DNS records via **Terraform** (Infrastructure as Code).

## Alternatives Considered

### Dynadot / Traditional Registrars

* **Pros**: Simple default when buying a domain.
* **Cons**: Lacks native Infrastructure as Code support. No version history.
* **Decision**: Rejected based on prior negative experience with `robbiepalmer.com`.

### AWS Route53

* **Pros**: The industry standard for programmatic DNS. Excellent reliability.
* **Cons**: Costs money ($0.50 per hosted zone per month). Requires an AWS account, introducing significant "Platform Overhead" (IAM, billing, security config) just for DNS.
* **Decision**: Rejected due to cost and complexity.

### Google Cloud DNS

* **Pros**: Similar to Route53.
* **Cons**: Similar platform overhead to AWS.
* **Decision**: Rejected.

# Consequences

### Positive

* **Consolidation**: DNS and Hosting are managed in the same portal (Cloudflare).
* **Infrastructure as Code**: All DNS records can be defined in `.tf` files, versioned in git, and reviewed via Pull Requests.
* **Cost**: Cloudflare DNS is free.
* **Performance & Security**: Access to Cloudflare's fast edge network, free unmetered DDoS protection, and one-click DNSSEC.

### Negative

* **Migration**: None (domain was initialized on Cloudflare).
