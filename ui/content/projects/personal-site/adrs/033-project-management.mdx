# Context

As a solo founder/engineer working across multiple devices (laptop, mobile), I need a project management system that supports my workflow without adding unnecessary complexity or cost.

Key requirements:

1. **Mobile Access**: Works well on mobile (preferably responsive web; native app optional but helpful) for capturing ideas and reviewing tasks on the go
2. **Hierarchy Support**: Supports epics and task hierarchy for organizing complex features
3. **Backlog Management**: Stack-ranking capability to maintain a prioritized single source of truth
4. **Lightweight**: Not overloaded or bloated with features I won't use
5. **GitHub Integration**: GitHub-centric or at least strong GitHub integration to keep work close to code
6. **Solo-Friendly**: Usable by a single developer without team-oriented overhead
7. **Cost**: Free or inexpensive for single-user use
8. **No Conflicts**: Must avoid account conflicts with work Jira instance
9. **Flexible Workflow**: Doesn't force sprint-based workflows (support for continuous flow)
10. **Quick Capture**: Easy to capture ideas and tasks rapidly when inspiration strikes

## Previous Situation

Tasks were scattered across multiple locations:

* Local markdown files spread across git worktrees
* Easily lost during git stashing or when switching between worktrees
* No access when away from development computer
* Couldn't use mobile coding agents (e.g., Claude Code mobile) as they didn't have access to task lists
* Additional tasks captured in mobile notes app, Trello, and Roam Research
* No stack-ranked single source of truth
* No central visibility into what needed to be done

This fragmentation created constant context switching, lost tasks, and made it impossible to work effectively from mobile devices.

# Decision

I will use **GitHub Issues** and **GitHub Projects** as my primary project management platform.

GitHub Issues provides:

* Native integration with code repositories (single platform for code and tasks)
* Free for public and private repositories
* Accessible from mobile web (responsive design)
* Support for labels, milestones, and assignees
* GitHub sub-issues for epic/task hierarchy
* Rich markdown support for task descriptions
* GitHub CLI (`gh`) for programmatic access and AI agent integration

GitHub Projects provides:

* Kanban boards for visual workflow management
* Custom fields for priority/stack ranking
* Backlog views and filtering
* No forced sprint methodology (continuous flow support)
* Zero additional cost (included with GitHub)

This decision establishes the platform layer that **CCPM** [ADR 027] builds upon, enabling local markdown task files to sync bidirectionally with GitHub Issues for remote access.

# Alternatives Considered

## Jira

* **Pros**: Industry standard, comprehensive feature set, excellent hierarchy support
* **Cons**:
  * Massive platform bloat for solo developer
  * Slow, complex UI
  * Would create account conflicts with work Jira instance
  * Expensive for personal use
  * Overly process-heavy for solo work
* **Decision**: Rejected - too heavyweight and would conflict with work account

## Linear

* **Pros**:
  * Beautiful, fast modern UI
  * Excellent keyboard shortcuts
  * Good mobile app
  * Strong GitHub integration
* **Cons**:
  * Opinionated hierarchy (Projects → Issues) limits flexibility
  * Requires at least 3-4 nesting levels for complex features
  * Linking related issues is cumbersome
  * Expensive ($8-10/user/month even for solo use)
  * Forces certain workflows
* **Decision**: Rejected - too opinionated and costly for solo developer

## Shortcut (formerly Clubhouse)

* **Pros**:
  * Good balance of features
  * Epic/story hierarchy
  * Reasonable pricing
* **Cons**:
  * Another platform to manage
  * Less tight GitHub integration than native solution
  * Mobile experience not as polished
* **Decision**: Rejected - GitHub-native solution preferred

## Zenhub

* **Pros**:
  * Built on top of GitHub Issues
  * Adds burndown charts, sprints, estimates
  * Browser extension integrates directly into GitHub UI
* **Cons**:
  * Adds sprint-based workflows I want to avoid
  * Requires browser extension (limits mobile access)
  * Paid product ($8.33/user/month)
  * Adds complexity on top of GitHub
* **Decision**: Rejected - forces sprint methodology and costs money

## Asana

* **Pros**:
  * Comprehensive task management
  * Free tier for individuals
  * Mobile apps available
* **Cons**:
  * Not developer-focused
  * Weak GitHub integration
  * Another platform to manage
  * UI feels corporate/process-heavy
* **Decision**: Rejected - not GitHub-centric enough

## ClickUp

* **Pros**:
  * Extremely feature-rich
  * Customizable views
  * Free tier available
* **Cons**:
  * Feature overload (violates "lightweight" requirement)
  * Slow, bloated interface
  * Not developer-centric
  * Weak GitHub integration
* **Decision**: Rejected - too bloated

## Trello

* **Pros**:
  * Simple, visual Kanban boards
  * Free tier
  * Mobile app
  * Easy quick capture
* **Cons**:
  * Limited hierarchy (no true epic support)
  * No stack-ranking or priority management
  * Weak GitHub integration
  * Feature development has stagnated
  * No programmatic API access in free tier
* **Decision**: Rejected - insufficient hierarchy and GitHub integration

# Consequences

## Positive

* **Platform Consolidation**: All code and tasks live in GitHub (single platform principle)
* **Zero Additional Cost**: No subscription fees for project management tooling
* **Mobile Access**: GitHub's responsive web interface enables task review and creation from any device
* **AI Agent Integration**: GitHub CLI enables CCPM and other tools to programmatically manage tasks
* **Future-Proof**: GitHub is foundational infrastructure unlikely to disappear or break compatibility
* **No Account Conflicts**: Separate from work Jira, uses existing GitHub account
* **Flexible Workflow**: No forced sprint methodology - supports continuous flow
* **Quick Capture**: Can create issues quickly via mobile web or GitHub mobile app
* **Single Source of Truth**: Stack-ranked backlog in GitHub Projects provides definitive prioritization

## Negative

* **Limited Features**: GitHub Projects lacks advanced features like time tracking, burndown charts, velocity metrics
* **No Native Offline**: Requires internet connection (though git itself works offline)
* **UI Limitations**: GitHub's project management UI is less polished than dedicated tools like Linear
* **Query Limitations**: GitHub Projects query language is less powerful than dedicated PM tools
* **Learning Curve**: GitHub Projects V2 has different patterns than traditional PM tools

## Notes

* This decision is complementary to **ADR 027 (CCPM)**, which provides the local-markdown-to-GitHub-Issues sync layer
* Together, these ADRs establish a "GitHub-native, AI-friendly" project management workflow
* The combination enables both local markdown task files (for AI agents) and remote GitHub Issues (for mobile access)
