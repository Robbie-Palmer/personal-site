# Context

As a solo founder/engineer working across multiple devices (laptop, mobile), I need a project management system that supports my workflow without adding unnecessary complexity or cost.

Key requirements:

1. **Mobile Access**: Works well on mobile (preferably responsive web; native app optional but helpful) for capturing ideas and reviewing tasks on the go
2. **Hierarchy Support**: Supports epics and task hierarchy for organizing complex features
3. **Backlog Management**: Stack-ranking capability to maintain a prioritized single source of truth
4. **Lightweight**: Not overloaded or bloated with features I won't use
5. **GitHub Integration**: GitHub-centric or at least strong GitHub integration to keep work close to code
6. **Solo-Friendly**: Usable by a single developer without team-oriented overhead
7. **Cost**: Free or inexpensive for single-user use
8. **No Conflicts**: Must avoid account conflicts with work Jira instance
9. **Flexible Workflow**: Doesn't force sprint-based workflows (support for continuous flow)
10. **Quick Capture**: Easy to capture ideas and tasks rapidly when inspiration strikes

## Previous Situation

Tasks were scattered across multiple locations:

* Local markdown files spread across git worktrees (via CCPM \[ADR 027])
* Easily lost during git stashing or when switching between worktrees
* No access when away from development computer
* Couldn't use mobile coding agents (e.g., Claude Code mobile) as they didn't have access to task lists
* Additional tasks captured in mobile notes app, Trello, and Roam Research
* No stack-ranked single source of truth
* No central visibility into what needed to be done

This fragmentation created constant context switching, lost tasks, and made it impossible to work effectively from mobile devices.

**CCPM Limitations**: While CCPM \[ADR 027] provided local markdown task files that synced to GitHub Issues, it relied on GitHub Projects for the project management UI layer. GitHub Projects has critical mobile limitations (see alternatives section below), making the overall solution inadequate for mobile-first workflow.

# Decision

I will use **[Shortcut](https://shortcut.com/)** (formerly Clubhouse) as my primary project management platform.

Shortcut provides:

* **Excellent Mobile Support**: Responsive web interface that works flawlessly on mobile, supports full task creation and editing including descriptions
* **Epic/Story Hierarchy**: Native support for Epics → Stories → Tasks with proper nesting
* **Stack Ranking**: Built-in priority management and backlog ordering
* **GitHub Integration**: Automatic linking between stories and GitHub PRs/commits via branch naming patterns
* **Continuous Flow**: No forced sprint methodology - supports Kanban-style continuous delivery
* **Solo-Friendly**: Works well for individual developers without team ceremony overhead
* **Cost-Effective**: Free tier for up to 10 users (more than sufficient for solo use)
* **Quick Capture**: Fast story creation from any device, including mobile
* **Lightweight**: Focused feature set without the bloat of enterprise tools

This decision supersedes **\[ADR 027] (CCPM)** as the primary project management approach.

## Alignment with Building Philosophy

This decision aligns with several [building philosophy](/projects/building-philosophy) principles:

* **Ship Incrementally**: Shortcut's continuous flow model (no forced sprints) enables rapid iteration and deployment without artificial sprint boundaries
* **Lean & Agile**: Lightweight, focused feature set avoids bloat and speculative features - builds only what's needed for solo developer workflow
* **Choose Boring Technologies**: Shortcut is a mature, well-established platform with proven track record and extensive documentation

However, it **diverges** from one key principle:

* **Minimize Platforms, Maximize Velocity**: Adding Shortcut introduces another platform beyond GitHub, increasing context-switching overhead

This divergence is **intentional and justified**: The velocity gains from superior mobile experience and stack-ranking outweigh the platform consolidation cost. GitHub Projects' mobile limitations would create more friction (unable to capture tasks on-the-go) than the overhead of managing one additional platform.

# Alternatives Considered

## GitHub Issues + GitHub Projects

* **Pros**:
  * Native GitHub integration (single platform)
  * Free for all repositories
  * GitHub CLI for programmatic access
  * Sub-issues for hierarchy
* **Cons**:
  * **Critical**: GitHub mobile app and mobile website don't properly support GitHub Projects
  * **Cannot edit issue descriptions from mobile**
  * **Cannot create new issues with Projects metadata from mobile**
  * Projects UI is clunky even on desktop
  * Limited priority/ranking features
  * Query language less powerful than dedicated tools
* **Decision**: Rejected - mobile experience is inadequate for on-the-go workflow

## Zenhub

* **Pros**:
  * Built directly on GitHub Issues
  * Adds powerful sprint/epic features
  * Good estimation and reporting
  * Strong GitHub integration (native)
* **Cons**:
  * Requires browser extension for full experience (limits mobile)
  * Forces sprint-based workflows (estimates, burndown charts)
  * Paid product ($8.33/user/month)
  * Mobile experience via web is limited without extension
* **Decision**: Rejected - close second, but mobile limitations and forced sprint methodology were dealbreakers

## Jira

* **Pros**: Industry standard, comprehensive feature set, excellent hierarchy support
* **Cons**:
  * Massive platform bloat for solo developer
  * Slow, complex UI
  * **Would create account conflicts with work Jira instance**
  * Expensive for personal use
  * Overly process-heavy for solo work
* **Decision**: Rejected - too heavyweight and would conflict with work account

## Linear

* **Pros**:
  * Beautiful, fast modern UI
  * Excellent keyboard shortcuts
  * Good mobile app
  * Strong GitHub integration
* **Cons**:
  * Opinionated hierarchy (Projects → Issues) limits flexibility
  * Requires at least 3-4 nesting levels for complex features
  * Linking related issues is cumbersome
  * Expensive ($8-10/user/month even for solo use)
  * Forces certain workflows
* **Decision**: Rejected - too opinionated and costly for solo developer

## Asana

* **Pros**:
  * Comprehensive task management
  * Free tier for individuals
  * Mobile apps available
* **Cons**:
  * Not developer-focused
  * Weak GitHub integration
  * Another platform to manage
  * UI feels corporate/process-heavy
* **Decision**: Rejected - not GitHub-centric enough

## ClickUp

* **Pros**:
  * Extremely feature-rich
  * Customizable views
  * Free tier available
* **Cons**:
  * Feature overload (violates "lightweight" requirement)
  * Slow, bloated interface
  * Not developer-centric
  * Weak GitHub integration
* **Decision**: Rejected - too bloated

## Trello

* **Pros**:
  * Simple, visual Kanban boards
  * Free tier
  * Mobile app
  * Easy quick capture
* **Cons**:
  * Limited hierarchy (no true epic support)
  * No stack-ranking or priority management
  * Weak GitHub integration
  * Feature development has stagnated
  * No programmatic API access in free tier
* **Decision**: Rejected - insufficient hierarchy and GitHub integration

# Consequences

## Positive

* **Excellent Mobile Experience**: Full-featured mobile web interface enables task creation, editing, and review from any device
* **Quick Capture**: Can rapidly create and organize tasks when inspiration strikes, from anywhere
* **Stack-Ranked Backlog**: Single source of truth for prioritized work
* **GitHub Integration**: Automatic linking between Shortcut stories and GitHub PRs/commits keeps work connected to code
* **Flexible Workflow**: No forced sprint methodology - supports continuous flow and Kanban-style delivery
* **Hierarchy Support**: Epic → Story → Task structure organizes complex features clearly
* **Cost-Effective**: Free tier supports solo developer workflow indefinitely
* **Lightweight**: Focused feature set without enterprise bloat
* **No Account Conflicts**: Separate from work Jira, dedicated personal account

## Negative

* **Another Platform**: Not GitHub-native - adds another service to the workflow (violates "single platform" principle)
* **Vendor Dependency**: Reliant on Shortcut's continued free tier and service availability
* **Less AI-Friendly**: No local markdown files for AI agents to read/edit directly (unlike CCPM approach)
* **Migration Risk**: If Shortcut changes pricing or shuts down, would need to migrate to another platform
* **Limited CLI**: No robust CLI for programmatic access (unlike GitHub CLI)

## Notes

* This decision **supersedes \[ADR 027] (CCPM)**, which relied on GitHub Projects as the UI layer
* The mobile limitations of GitHub Projects made the CCPM approach unworkable for a mobile-first workflow
* Zenhub was the closest alternative but was rejected due to browser extension requirement and forced sprint methodology
* The trade-off of adding another platform (Shortcut) is worthwhile for the superior mobile experience
