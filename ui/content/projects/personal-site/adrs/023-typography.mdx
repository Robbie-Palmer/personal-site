# Context

I have chosen [MDX](/projects/personal-site/adrs/020-mdx) for my content, which allows me to mix markdown with React components. However, this introduces a styling challenge. Unlike standard react components where I control the class names directly, MDX (and markdown in general) produces raw HTML elements (`<p>`, `<h1>`, `<blockquote>`, etc.) that are unstyled by default, especially when using Tailwind CSS's preflight which resets all browser default styles.

I need a way to style this "third-party" HTML—content effectively generated outside of my direct class-name control—consistently and beautifully without manually targeting every single tag in a global stylesheet or creating a custom wrapper component for every HTML element that MDX spits out.

# Decision

I will use the official **Tailwind CSS Typography plugin** (`@tailwindcss/typography`) to style all MDX content.

This plugin provides a set of `prose` classes that you can add to any element to add sensible typographic defaults to any vanilla HTML you've got inside that element, like HTML rendered from Markdown.

# Alternatives Considered

**Roll Your Own Styles (Global CSS)**:

* **Pros**: Infinite customizability, zero dependencies.
* **Cons**: Extremely tedious. I would have to write custom CSS for every single HTML element (`h1` through `h6`, `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `blockquote`, `pre`, `code`, `table`, etc.) and handle all the spacing/margins between them. This is "undifferentiated heavy lifting."
* **Why not**: Reinventing typography styles is a waste of time—use [Boring Technologies](/projects?tab=philosophy#choose-boring-technologies) instead.

**Custom MDX Provider Components**:

* **Pros**: Allows replacing every standard HTML tag with a custom React component (e.g., replace `<p>` with `<MyParagraph>`).
* **Cons**: While powerful for specific interactivity, doing this *just* for styling is overkill. It adds significant runtime overhead and bloats the component tree.
* **Why not**: Good for functional enhancements (like adding copy buttons to code blocks), but bad for basic typographic styling.

**Styling Libraries (e.g., Styled Components)**:

* **Pros**: Scoped styles.
* **Cons**: Adds a runtime JS library for CSS, which I'm avoiding in favor of Tailwind.
* **Why not**: Inconsistent with the rest of the project's styling approach ([ADR 005: Tailwind CSS](/projects/personal-site/adrs/005-tailwindcss)).

# Consequences

**Positive:**

* **Velocity**: I can style an entire article with a single class: `prose`. Instant professional typography.
* **Consistency**: Returns to the "[Boring Technology](/projects?tab=philosophy#choose-boring-technologies)" principle—using the tool designed by the framework authors for exactly this use case.
* **Dark Mode Support**: The plugin has first-class support for dark mode (`dark:prose-invert`), saving me from handling color inversion manually for every element.
* **Customizability**: I can still customize the theme via `tailwind.config.js` if I need specific brand overrides (like link colors or font families), but the defaults are excellent.

**Negative:**

* **Override Complexity**: Occasionally, overriding a specific nested behavior in the prose plugin can be tricky and requires understanding its complex selector specificity.
* **Plugin Weight**: Adds a small amount of CSS to the bundle, but far less than writing it all manually.
