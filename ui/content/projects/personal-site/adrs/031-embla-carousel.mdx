# Context

I need a carousel component to showcase blog posts on the landing page with auto-scrolling and responsive behavior (1-3 posts per view across mobile to desktop).

Traditional carousel solutions present several tradeoffs:

* **Swiper.js**: Feature-rich and popular, but heavy (30KB+ gzipped) with many unused features for this simple use case
* **React Slick**: Widespread in the React ecosystem, but built on jQuery dependencies and lacks TypeScript support
* **Keen Slider**: Lightweight and TypeScript-first, but less mature ecosystem and fewer plugins
* **Pure CSS + Scroll Snap**: Minimal overhead, but lacks programmatic control for auto-scroll and complex navigation patterns
* **Building Custom**: Maximum control, but introduces maintenance burden for solving an already-solved problem

I want a solution that prioritizes:

* **Headless Architecture**: Pure logic with no UI opinions, allowing me to standardize the design language across the site using my own components and Tailwind classes
* **Performance**: Lightweight bundle size and smooth 60fps animations
* **TypeScript Support**: First-class types that align with the **LLM-Optimized** principle
* **Plugin Architecture**: Extensibility without bloat—load only what's needed
* **Framework Flexibility**: React integration today, but not locked into React if requirements change
* **AI Familiarity**: Well-documented APIs that LLMs can work with effectively

# Decision

I decided to use **[Embla Carousel](https://www.embla-carousel.com/)** with the following packages:

* `embla-carousel`: Framework-agnostic core (\~6KB gzipped)
* `embla-carousel-react`: React wrapper with hooks
* `embla-carousel-auto-scroll`: Plugin for auto-scrolling behavior

This aligns with the **Choose Boring Technologies** and **LLM-Optimized** principles. Embla is TypeScript-first, has clear documentation, and uses a composable hook-based API that AI agents understand well.

Notably, Embla provides a [**builder/playground**](https://www.embla-carousel.com/examples/generator/) on their website where you can generate and copy navigation code (buttons, dots, auto-scroll) directly into your codebase—similar to the **shadcn/ui** philosophy ([ADR 019](/projects/personal-site/adrs/019-shadcn)). This gives us ownership of the implementation rather than hiding it behind opaque library abstractions.

## Interactive Demo

Here's the carousel in action, using the same `ContentCarousel` component that powers the blog and ADR carousels across this site:

<EmblaDemoCarousel />

# Consequences

### Pros

* **Truly Headless**: Embla provides only carousel logic—no pre-styled UI components or CSS to override. This allows complete control over the design language, ensuring carousel navigation matches the rest of the site's Tailwind-based aesthetic without fighting vendor styles.
* **Lightweight**: The core is \~6KB gzipped—significantly smaller than Swiper (\~31-45KB). We only load the auto-scroll plugin (\~2KB) when needed.
* **Design System Consistency**: Because we build navigation components from scratch, they naturally align with our existing UI patterns (shadcn/ui components, Tailwind design tokens). No visual inconsistencies from library-imposed styles.
* **TypeScript-First**: Excellent type inference with `EmblaCarouselType` and `EmblaOptionsType`. The API is fully typed, reducing runtime errors and improving the agentic workflow.
* **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated transforms, smooth 60fps animations, and no jQuery overhead.
* **Composability**: Plugin architecture means we pay only for features we use. The `AutoScroll` plugin handles the auto-scrolling behavior without polluting the core API.
* **Code Ownership**: The builder provides copy-paste navigation hooks (`usePrevNextButtons`, `useDotButton`) that live in our codebase (`ui/components/ui/carousel.tsx`). This is transparent, modifiable, and easier for AI agents to reason about than importing opaque components from `node_modules`.
* **React Hooks Integration**: The `useEmblaCarousel` hook fits naturally into React patterns. Custom hooks encapsulate carousel state logic cleanly.
* **Framework-Agnostic Core**: If we migrate away from React in the future, the core carousel logic remains reusable.

### Cons

* **Initial Setup Overhead**: Requires copying navigation code from the builder rather than importing pre-built components. However, this is a one-time cost and aligns with our shadcn philosophy of code ownership.
* **Smaller Ecosystem**: Fewer third-party plugins compared to Swiper, though the core plugin set (auto-scroll, auto-play, class names) covers most use cases.
