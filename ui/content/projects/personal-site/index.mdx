# Vision

This site is my personal portfolio. It provides me a space to share ideas, it helps build my network and provides
the tech stack for incubating projects.

It is a personal knowledge graph - inspired by tools like Roam Research and Obsidian,
but with full control over UI/UX, richer relations between content, and no vendor lock-in.
Those tools promised compounding returns from connected thinking but fell short.
I found them too inflexible, too siloed and did not lead to meaningful engagement.

# Problem Statement

I want:

* **A Unified presence**: One place for blog, resume, and projects instead of fragmented profiles across LinkedIn, Substack and GitHub
* **Low context-switching cost**: Self-documenting architecture so I can drop in and out of this codebase without losing momentum
* **Rich content**: A platform that supports long-form writing, diagrams, and interactive content

# User Stories

**For the audience:**

* As a friend, I want the highlights from research on topics like personal finance, so I can benefit from his research obsessions
* As a colleague, I want to understand Robbie's mental models on common engineering challenges, so we can align faster and avoid repeated debates
* As a developer evaluating this stack, I want to see architectural decisions documented, so I can learn from the tradeoffs
* As a hiring manager, I want to see evidence of systematic thinking beyond resume bullets, so I can assess seniority and culture fit

**For the author:**

* I want self-documenting projects, so I can context-switch efficiently when returning to the codebase
* I want a platform that can incubate SaaS ideas, so I have production-ready infrastructure when inspiration strikes
* I want a forcing function to ship end-to-end

# Platform Capabilities

## Knowledge Sharing & Collaboration

The blog serves multiple audiences with different needs:

* **Colleagues**: Engineering patterns, addressing recurring anti-patterns, reducing repeated debates. I can link to a thoroughly researched post instead of trying to re-establish the case from the ground up
* **Friends & family**: Personal finance insights, investing principles, life lessons
* **Public**: Thought leadership on topics I care about. Writing publicly forces an extra level of rigor.

## Content Publishing

* Long-form writing with MDX supporting diagrams, code blocks, and interactive components
* Multi-audience blog serving both technical and non-technical readers
* SEO-optimized for discoverability

## Professional Presence

* Interactive resume with structured experience data and technology breadth
* Project showcase with linked PRDs and [ADRs](/projects/personal-site?tab=adrs) demonstrating technical leadership
* Visual communication and data visualization demos

## Meta-Benefits

* LLM-readable codebase optimized for AI-assisted development workflows
* Self-documenting architecture reducing context-switching cost
* Extensible foundation for future ventures and experiments

# Building Philosophy

This project follows my [building philosophy](/projects?tab=philosophy).
Each ADR references specific principles to explain why certain trade-offs were accepted and others rejected.

# What This Is Not

* **Not a CMS with a GUI**: Content is code, managed via git. This is intentional—it keeps everything in one workflow and makes the site itself a demonstration of development practices
* **Not a finished product**: It's a living platform that evolves with my needs. The backlog is always longer than the changelog
* **Not a template for others to fork**: Though you're welcome to learn from it. The decisions here reflect my specific needs and preferences
* **Not a walled garden**: Content is meant to be shared, referenced, and built upon

# Future Direction

This site is infrastructure to enable future work:

* **SaaS incubator**: The tech stack and deployment pipeline are production-grade. When an idea is worth pursuing, the foundation is already there
* **Expanded project documentation**: More PRDs and ADRs as case studies in technical decision-making
* **Enhanced data visualization**: Richer interactive content and visual communication
