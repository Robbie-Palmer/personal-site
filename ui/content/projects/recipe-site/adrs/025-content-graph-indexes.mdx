This acts as an interim, in-memory database-like layer over content files.
It keeps us SSG-friendly now while giving us flexible query capabilities as the product grows.

Relevant entities are:

* recipes
* ingredients
* tags/cuisines

The main value is consistent query composition (for example: "recipes by ingredient + cuisine", "related recipes", "ingredient usage") without introducing a real database yet.

This graph is distinct from the personal-site content graph and should remain recipe-domain only.
