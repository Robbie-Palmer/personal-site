SSG is the right default for the current roadmap.

* **Phase 1-2 (content-first)**: recipe pages, browsing, and search are fully static from build-time content.
* **Phase 3 (light interactivity)**: filters, sorting, and saved preferences stay client-side without changing the rendering model.
* **Phase 4+ (user-specific features)**: authenticated flows (for example collections, ratings, or collaborative editing) are likely the point where parts of the app should move to SSR/ISR or API-backed islands.

Keep SSG until we need request-time personalization or frequent per-item mutations.
