# Vision

The goal was to enable "Real-Time Cyber Defense" by moving security observability from post-hoc batch analysis to
real-time stream processing. By augmenting legacy SIEM/SOAR tools with a "central nervous system" based on Confluent
and Kafka, I aimed to enable detecting and responding to threats in milliseconds, not hours.

# Problem Statement

* **Latency**: Traditional SIEMs are optimized for historical reports, not real-time understanding.
* **Unstructured Data Risk**: 80-90% of organizational data is unstructured (emails, logs, chat). Because this data *might* contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), it is often indiscriminately locked down, making it unusable for analytics.
* **Siloed Security**: Security responsibility is often fragmented across widely varying tools and teams.

# Methodology

I built a suite of stream-processing accelerators to provide granular, entity-level control over unstructured data in motion:

* **PII Detector App**: A stream-processing application using cutting-edge NLP models (spaCy/Huggingface) to inspect messages, detect 25+ entity types (names, credit cards, SSNs), and redact them in real-time.
* **Granular Governance**: Instead of locking down entire datasets, I enabled "entity-level" governance—redacting only the sensitive PII while letting the rest of the valuable data flow to downstream analytics.
* **Ecosystem Integration**: Developed components for the entire Kafka ecosystem:
  * **ksqlDB UDFs**: SQL functions for ad-hoc PII queries.
  * **Kafka Connect SMTs**: Single Message Transforms to redact data *before* it even hits the broker.

# Impact

* **Unlocked Data Utility**: Allowed organizations to safely use previously "dark" unstructured data for analytics without compromising privacy.
* **Real-Time Response**: Enabled immediate alerting on data leaks or policy violations.
* **Commercial Asset**: This solution was packaged as an accelerator for Confluent's Professional Services, driving enterprise adoption of real-time data governance.
