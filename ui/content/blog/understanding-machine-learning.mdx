Machine learning has transformed how we approach complex problems. This post introduces fundamental concepts and practical applications.

## Core Concepts

Machine learning involves training algorithms to learn patterns from data. The main categories include:

1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error

## A Simple Example

Here's a basic linear regression example using scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Training data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])

# Create and train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict([[6]])
print(f"Prediction: {prediction[0]}")
```

## Model Evaluation Metrics

| Metric   | Use Case           | Range |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| Accuracy | Classification     | 0-1   |
| RMSE     | Regression         | 0-âˆž   |
| F1 Score | Imbalanced classes | 0-1   |

## Best Practices

> Always split your data into training and testing sets to avoid overfitting. A common split is 80% training and 20% testing.

## Next Steps

To dive deeper into machine learning:

* Explore popular libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch
* Practice with real datasets from Kaggle
* Build projects to solidify your understanding
* Stay updated with the latest research and techniques

Machine learning is a vast field, but starting with these fundamentals will set you on the right path.
