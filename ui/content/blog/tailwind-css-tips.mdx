Tailwind CSS has revolutionized how we write CSS. Here are some tips to help you get the most out of it.

## Customizing Your Theme

Tailwind's configuration file lets you extend the default theme:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        brand: {
          50: '#f0f9ff',
          500: '#0ea5e9',
          900: '#0c4a6e',
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Useful Utility Patterns

### Centering Content

The classic centering problem, solved elegantly:

```html
<div class="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
  <div>Centered content</div>
</div>
```

### Responsive Design

Tailwind makes responsive design straightforward:

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <!-- Grid items -->
</div>
```

## Component Extraction

Don't repeat yourself! Extract common patterns:

* Use `@apply` in CSS for component classes
* Create React components for reusable UI elements
* Consider using **shadcn/ui** for pre-built components

## Performance Tips

* Purge unused styles in production
* Use JIT mode for faster builds
* Keep utility classes composable and atomic
