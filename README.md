My personal website, blog, resume, and recipes at [robbiepalmer.me](https://robbiepalmer.me), plus
the projects incubated here alongside it. Each project owns its details in its own README:

- [`ui/`](ui/), the website itself (Next.js static export on Cloudflare Pages).
  Content authoring guides: [blog](ui/content/blog/README.md),
  [projects](ui/content/projects/README.md)
- [`functions/`](functions/README.md), Pages Functions running alongside the static site
- [`workers/recipe-api/`](workers/recipe-api/README.md), API and auth Worker behind the recipe features
- [`workers/recipe-ingest/`](workers/recipe-ingest/README.md), durable photo-to-recipe ingestion pipeline
- [`packages/`](packages/), shared libraries (database schema, domain model, parsing, observability)
- [`ml-pipelines/`](ml-pipelines/README.md), DVC-managed ML experiments feeding the recipe features
- [`ai-review/`](ai-review/README.md), stateful AI code-review service
- [`homelab/`](homelab/README.md), home lab declared as code
- [`infra/`](infra/README.md), independently stateful Terraform roots for bootstrap, the public platform, and remote development
  for Cloudflare, Neon, and PostHog
- [`backups/`](backups/README.md), encrypted Postgres backups to R2
- [`docs/`](docs/), internal runbooks: [external dashboards](docs/dashboards.md),
  [social preview QA](docs/social-previews.md), [database operations](docs/database.md),
  [preview environments](docs/preview-environments.md), [secrets](docs/secrets.md)

## Development

All build and development tasks run through [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/). Task definitions live in
`.mise.toml` (repo-wide) and each project's own `mise.toml`; browse everything with `mise task --all`.

```bash
mise //:install   # install dependencies
mise //ui:dev     # site only, http://localhost:3000
mise run //:dev   # site + recipe-api Worker together (requires Doppler)
```
