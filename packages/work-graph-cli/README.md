# Work Graph CLI

`work-graph` is the installable Node.js client for the canonical Work Graph
REST API. Hey API generates its Fetch client, endpoint functions, request
types, response types, and Zod request schemas from
`workers/work-graph-api/openapi.json`. A tRPC command router composes those
generated schemas into the task-oriented CLI. trpc-cli derives argument
parsing, validation, nested commands, and help from that router, so command
inputs and help do not have separate handwritten definitions.

## Install

Build and pack the CLI from this repository:

```sh
mise //packages/work-graph-cli:build
cd packages/work-graph-cli
pnpm pack
npm install --global ./work-graph-cli-0.1.0.tgz
```

Node.js 22.18 or newer is required. The generated Fetch client and Zod schemas
are included in the package.

## Agent quick start

`prime` prints the current short workflow without contacting the API:

```sh
work-graph prime
work-graph ready
work-graph claim cli-8
work-graph note cli-8 --content "HTTP tests pass"
work-graph touch cli-8
work-graph release cli-8 \
  --merge-evidence https://github.com/example/work-graph/pull/8 \
  --deployment-evidence https://work-graph.example.com/health
```

Codex sessions use their thread ID as worker provenance. Other clients should
set `WORK_GRAPH_WORKER_ID` once. Commands that already name a ticket find that
worker's active lease and fencing epoch. Scripts may instead pass `--lease-id`
and `--epoch` together to avoid the lookup.

## Configure

Set the API URL in the environment or pass it before the command:

```sh
export WORK_GRAPH_API_URL=https://work-graph.example.com
work-graph queue

work-graph --api-url http://127.0.0.1:8787 queue
```

The CLI requires HTTPS except for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `[::1]`.

When `WORK_GRAPH_API_URL` is absent, an API command automatically re-runs under
the `work-graph/prd_work_graph` Doppler config. Help and `prime` do not contact
Doppler. The CLI looks in the standard Homebrew and system binary directories;
set `WORK_GRAPH_DOPPLER_BIN` to an absolute path for another installation. The
explicit form remains available for scripts:

```sh
doppler run --project work-graph --config prd_work_graph -- work-graph ready
```

Without Doppler, set the API URL and both Cloudflare Access service-token
variables when the API is protected:

```sh
export CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID=example.access
export CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET=secret
export WORK_GRAPH_CF_ACCESS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://work-graph.example.com
```

The allowlist accepts comma-separated exact origins. You can also repeat
`--cf-access-allowed-origin <origin>` before the command. When credentials are
present, the CLI refuses to make a request unless the API origin appears in
that allowlist. It never follows HTTP redirects. These two checks stop a changed
API URL or cross-origin redirect from receiving the Access headers. Credential
values are read only from the environment. The command parser has no credential
flags.

For the production service, Doppler supplies the URL, allowlist, and Access
pair as one unit. The CLI's fixed bootstrap config keeps those values together.

## Commands

Run `work-graph --help` for the compact command list. `queue` selects the
`ready` stage unless `--stage` or `--all` changes it. Results follow the same
priority order used by an unscoped `claim`. Lease duration defaults to 900
seconds. `claim` also reads `WORK_GRAPH_WORKER_ID` when `--worker-id` is absent.
Run `work-graph <command> --help` for schema-derived argument and option help.
`ready` is the concise form of the default `queue`; `touch <ticket>` renews its
active lease.

```sh
work-graph scope put work-graph \
  --kind project \
  --title "Work Graph" \

```

`dependency add` rejects self-dependencies and edges that would create a cycle
across dependency and hierarchy relationships. Both dependency mutations accept
`--idempotency-key`. Removing an edge leaves its `dependency.added` event in the
immutable event log and appends a `dependency.removed` event.

The `metadata` commands expose the complete stored history needed to resume or
audit one work item. Notes include their content, dependency results contain
current incoming and outgoing edges, leases retain every worker and outcome,
and attention results include resolutions. Decomposition, cancellation, and
release results come from the immutable event log. Release events include both
merge and deployment evidence.

`note` records immutable working history. It uses the ticket's active lease by
default; pass the current lease ID and fencing epoch together when a script
already has them. `comment` appends immutable discussion after release. It cannot
reopen work or change its release event, evidence, lease history, or
timestamps. A comment requires `--author` or `WORK_GRAPH_WORKER_ID`. The stored
note returns that provenance, a `post_release` kind, a null lease ID, and its
database creation time. Both kinds appear in `metadata notes`. The API rejects
comments on open or cancelled work.

Every metadata response is a JSON object with `items` and `nextCursor`.
`notes` uses a note UUID cursor and `dependencies` uses an opaque cursor.
`events`, `decompositions`, `cancellations`, and `releases` continue with
`--after-sequence`. `leases` continues with `--after-epoch`. Pass `--limit` to
any metadata command. The default page size is 50 and the maximum is 100.

`release` is the successful terminal transition. For repository-backed work,
use it only after the change is merged and deployed. The command requires
evidence for both. It does not return unfinished work to the queue.

`scope put` uses its positional ID as the stable source key. Repeating it
replaces the title, URLs, and source revision while preserving relationships
and scheduling position for that ID. `scope link` adds a directed
parent-to-child relationship and rejects cycles.

Priority commands use relative anchors. `scope move` compares initiatives only
with initiatives and projects only with projects. `priority move` compares a
ticket only with tickets in the same scheduling project. New entries start at
the median. Expedites require a reason and temporarily donate their urgency to
unresolved blockers.

Decomposition accepts contract-shaped JSON arrays. The optional child claim
gets a generated lease ID unless `--claim-lease-id` supplies one.

```sh
work-graph decompose parent-1 \
  --children-json '[{"id":"child-1","title":"First child","rank":1}]' \
  --dependencies-json '[]' \
  --claim-work-item-id child-1
```

Attention has three subcommands:

```sh
work-graph attention list
work-graph attention request cli-8 \
  --kind decision \
  --question "Which deployment target should I use?"
work-graph attention resolve "$ATTENTION_ID" --resolution "Use Cloudflare Workers"
```

`create`, `note`, `comment`, `decompose`, `attention request`, and
`attention resolve` accept `--idempotency-key <uuid>`. Note and attention IDs
are generated when `--id` is absent. When a mutation has an idempotency key,
the CLI derives any missing mutation or child-lease UUID from that key.
Retrying the same command therefore sends the same request fingerprint.

## JSON and exit codes

Every completed command writes one compact JSON document to stdout. Errors
write one JSON document to stderr:

```json
{"error":{"code":"WORK_ITEM_NOT_FOUND","message":"Work item not found","status":404}}
```

Every command also accepts its complete Zod input through `--json`, which is
useful when an agent already has a structured object:

```sh
work-graph create --json '{"id":"cli-8","title":"Build the TypeScript CLI"}'
```

| Code | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Invalid arguments or unsafe configuration |
| 3 | Authentication or authorization failure, HTTP 401 or 403 |
| 4 | Resource not found, HTTP 404 |
| 5 | Work Graph state conflict, HTTP 409 |
| 6 | Request rejected, HTTP 400 or 422 |
| 7 | Work Graph server failure, HTTP 5xx |
| 8 | Network, redirect, malformed response, or other HTTP failure |

## Development

The normal build regenerates the SDK and request schemas before compiling:

```sh
mise //packages/work-graph-cli:build
```

Generate it directly after an API contract change, or run the same non-mutating
drift check used by CI:

```sh
mise //packages/work-graph-cli:openapi:generate
mise //packages/work-graph-cli:openapi:check
mise //packages/work-graph-cli:check
```

The Work Graph CI workflow runs both the API's canonical OpenAPI check and the
CLI check whenever either implementation or contract changes. CI fails when
the committed generated client or Zod schemas differ from a clean generation.
