# Work Graph

Use the CLI as the agent interface. Start with `work-graph prime` when the
available commands or local setup are unclear.

Production credentials live in Doppler. API commands load the fixed
`work-graph/prd_work_graph` config automatically when the environment is not
already present. If automatic startup is unavailable, use the explicit form:

```sh
doppler run --project work-graph --config prd_work_graph -- work-graph <command>
```

Never print, copy, or persist the Cloudflare Access values. Codex sessions use
their thread ID as worker provenance. `WORK_GRAPH_WORKER_ID` overrides it; other
clients must set that variable or pass `--worker-id` when claiming.

## Normal loop

1. Run `work-graph ready`. Inspect a candidate with `work-graph show <ticket>`.
2. Run `work-graph claim [ticket]`. With no ticket, the server chooses the
   highest-priority ready item.
3. Record durable findings or a handoff with
   `work-graph note <ticket> --content "..."`. The CLI finds the active lease
   and fencing epoch. Run `work-graph touch <ticket>` before a lease expires.
4. Release repository-backed work only after merge and production deployment:
   `work-graph release <ticket> --merge-evidence <url> --deployment-evidence <url>`.

`note`, `touch`, `decompose`, `attention request`, `release`, and `cancel` use
the ticket's active lease. Pass `--lease-id` and `--epoch` together only when a
script already has both values.

## Changes to the plan

- Reorder a ticket with `work-graph priority move <ticket> --above <ticket>` or
  `--below <ticket>`. Ticket order is local to its scheduling project.
- Add a blocking edge with
  `work-graph dependency add <dependent> <blocker>`.
- Use `work-graph expedite <ticket> --reason "..."` only for an explicit
  interruption. An expedite temporarily donates urgency to unresolved blockers.
- Use `work-graph attention request` when progress needs a decision, authority,
  access, review, or help. A blocking request ends the lease.
- `cancel` means the outcome is no longer wanted. It is not a way to return
  unfinished work to the queue.

Prefer the short commands above. Use `metadata`, explicit lease fields, and
`--json` for audits, recovery, or automation that needs the full contract.
